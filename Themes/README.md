# Arduino Dark Theme

## INSTALLATION  

* **Mac** users should look in `/Applications/Arduino.app/Contents/Java/lib` and replace the `theme` folder inside.  
* **Windows** is located in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Arduino\lib`.  
* **Linux** will be in `/usr/share/arduino/lib/` â€“ note you may need to install the Arduino IDE from the Arduino site, not a place like Ubuntu Software.
